Purpose of automation Framework

-> Enhance the efficiency of the team member/development team
-> Reduce the cross dependcy of the cases, with proper
   framework structure
-> Reduce the dependecy on manual testing
-> Find more and more product issue
-> Remove code redundancy.
-> Proper reporting of automated test cases.
-> Lower Maintaince of automation code.


Type of Framework

-> Linear or Scripting Framework: When we write single script code
                  that type of framework is knows as linear Framework

-> Modular Framework : In this framework we design module for each feature
               and re-use them when ever required.

-> Data driven Framework :  In this framework we read input data 
                from external and use in automation. e.g read data
                Excel sheet or Json file

-> Keyword Driven Framework : In this framework all the keywords are
                pre-written, just we need use it design test cases
                e.g   Robotframework

-> BDD(Behaviour Driven Framwork) : In this framework code is design
              as per feature beviour, and that will be in plain english
              so even non technical person can use it, and desing the test 
              cases


-> Hybrid Framework : This framework is combination of all the above framework.
                it is very flexible to extend upto any level.

Design Automation Framework:

(We will hybrid framework with page object model pattern)

1. Action code should be re-usable

   -> e.g click_element, send_keys
   
2. Element locator keep it seperate and re-usable.
   -> e.g ID, name, CSS

3. Product code should be manage seperately as per features.

4. Test Data should manage seperately.
    e.g. excel_sheet, json, yml, python

5. Test cases or test suites should manage separately.
