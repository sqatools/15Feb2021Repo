   @pytest.mark.smoke
   def test_function1:
	<test code>

   @pytest.mark.sanity
   def test_function1:
	<test code>

   -> pytest -v -m "marker"  test_suite.py

5. Fixture of the test cases
   -> fixture is a pre-requisite that user wants to execute before
      after copletion of test function execution.

    @pytest.fixture(scope='function')
     def setup():
      <fixture code>
       yield
      <Tead Down code>


  -> use of text ficture in test function name.

      det test_functio4(setup):
	<test code>
